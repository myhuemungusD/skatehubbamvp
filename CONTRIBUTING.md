# Contributing to SkateHubba

## Simple Rules
1. Open an issue first if it’s a new feature or large change.
2. Keep pull requests focused and not too large.
3. Use clear commit messages (e.g. `feat: add challenge list`).

## Flow
```
fork (if external) → branch → commit → push → open pull request
```

Suggested branch names:
- `feat/challenge-form`
- `fix/upload-bug`
- `chore/deps-update`

## Before a Pull Request
- App runs locally without crashing.
- No obvious console errors.

## Questions?
Open an issue with label `question`.
